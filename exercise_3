#1. Define a function `max()` that takes two numbers as arguments and returns the largest of them. Use the if-then-else construct available in Python. (It is true that Python has the `max()` function built in, but writing it yourself is nevertheless a good exercise ).
          
def max(num1, num2):
    if (num1 > num2): 
        return num1
    else:
        return num2

#2. Define a function `max_of_three()` that takes three numbers as arguments and returns the largest of them.   
   
def max_of_three(num1, num2, num3):
    return max(max(num1, num2), num3)

#3. Define a function that computes the length of a given list or string. ( It is true that Python has the `len()` function built in, but writing it yourself is nevertheless a good exercise ).

    def length(param):
        if (param == [] or param == ""):
            return 0
        else:
            return 1+length(param[1:])
        
#4. Write a function that takes a character ( i.e. a string of length 1 ) and returns `True` if it is a vowel, `False` otherwise.

    def isVowel(char):
        return char in ['a','e','i','o','u']
    
#5. Write a function `translate()` that will translate a text into "rövarspråket" (Swedish for "robber's language"). That is, double every consonant and place an occurrence of "o" in between. For example, `translate("this is fun")` should return the string `"tothohisos isos fofunon".`

    def robberLanguagizer(text):
        res = ""
        for i in range(len(text)):
            res += text[i]
            if (text[i] not in ['a','e','i','o','u'] and text[i] != ' '):
                res += 'o' + text[i]
        return res
          
#6. Define a function `sum()` and a function `multiply()` that sums and multiplies (respectively) all the numbers in a list of numbers. For example, `sum([1, 2, 3, 4])` should return `10`, and `multiply([1, 2, 3, 4])` should return `24`.

    def sum(nums):
        res = 0
        for i in nums:
            res += i
        return res
    
    def multiply(nums):
        res = 1
        for i in nums:
            res *= i
        return res
        
#7. Define a function `reverse()` that computes the reversal of a string. For example, `reverse( "I am testing" )` should return the string `"gnitset ma I"`.


def reverse(str):
   newStr = ''
   for i in range(1,len(str)+1):
        newStr += str[-i]
   return newStr

#8. Define a function `is_palindrome()` that recognizes palindromes (i.e. words that look the same written backwards). For example, `is_palindrome( "radar" )` should return `True`.

#Solution(using my solution for reverse)
def is_palindrome(text):
    return text == reverse(text)


#9. Write a function `is_member()` that takes a value ( i.e. a number, string, etc ) `x` and a list of values `a`, and returns True if `x` is a member of `a`, `False` otherwise. (Note that this is exactly what the in operator does, but for the sake of the exercise you should pretend Python did not have this operator).

def is_member(x,a):
    for i in range(len(a)):
        if (a[i] == x):
            return True
    return False

#10. Define a function `overlapping()` that takes two lists and returns `True` if they have at least one member in common, `False` otherwise. You may use your `is_member()` function, or the in operator, but for the sake of the exercise, you should (also) write it using two nested for-loops.
    
def overlapping(l1,l2):
    for a in l1:
        for b in l2:
            if a == b:
                return True
    return False

#11. Define a function `generate_n_chars()` that takes an integer `n` and a character `c` and returns a string, `n` characters long, consisting only of c:s. For example, `generate_n_chars( 5,"x" )` should return the string `"xxxxx"`. (Python is unusual in that you can actually write an expression `5 * "x"` that will evaluate to `"xxxxx"`. For the sake of the exercise you should ignore that the problem can be solved in this manner ).
    
def generate_n_chars(n, c):
   res = ''
   for i in range(n):
        res += c
   return res

#12. Define a procedure `histogram()` that takes a list of integers and prints a histogram to the screen. For example, `histogram( [ 4, 9, 7 ] )` should print the following:

def histogram(listNums):
    for i in listNums:
        print ('*' * i)

#13. The function `max()` from exercise 1) and the function `max_of_three()` from exercise 2) will only work for two and three numbers, respectively. But suppose we have a much larger number of numbers, or suppose we cannot tell in advance how many they are? Write a function `max_in_list()` that takes a list of numbers and returns the largest one.
    
def max_in_list(listNums):
    if (len(listNums) == 1):
        return listNums[0]
    else:
        return max(listNums[0], max_in_list(listNums[1:]))
        
#14. Write a program that maps a list of words into a list of integers representing the lengths of the corresponding words.

def mapToLengths(words):
   listOfInts = []
   for word in words:
        listOfInts.append(len(word))
   return listOfInts

#15. Write a function `find_longest_word()` that takes a list of words and returns the length of the longest one.

#using previous questions solutions    
def find_longest_words(words):
    return max_in_list( mapToLengths(words) )

#16. Write a function `filter_long_words()` that takes a list of words and an integer `n` and returns the list of words that are longer than `n`.

    def filter_long_words(words,n):
        largerThanN = []
        for word in words:
           if len(word) > n:
                largerThanN.append(word)
        return largerThanN
#17. Write a version of a palindrome recognizer that also accepts phrase palindromes such as "Go hang a salami I'm a lasagna hog.", "Was it a rat I saw?", "Step on no pets", "Sit on a potato pan, Otis", "Lisa Bonet ate no basil", "Satan, oscillate my metallic sonatas", "I roamed under it as a tired nude Maori", "Rise to vote sir", or the exclamation "Dammit, I'm mad!". Note that punctuation, capitalization, and spacing are usually ignored.
    
def palindrome_recognizer_2(string):
    charsToOmit=" ,?'!."
    stringLowered = string.lower()
    stringOmitted = ""
    for i in stringLowered:
        if (i not in charsToOmit):
            stringOmitted += i
    return is_palindrome(stringOmitted)

def is_palindrome(text):
    if (len(text) <= 1):
        return True
    else:
        return text[0] == text[len(text) - 1] and is_palindrome(text[1:-1])
      
#18. A pangram is a sentence that contains all the letters of the English alphabet at least once, for example: "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog". Your task here is to write a function to check a sentence to see if it is a pangram or not.

def is_pangram(text):
    azChars='abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'
    for i in azChars:
        if i not in text:
            return False
    return True


#19. "99 Bottles of Beer" is a traditional song in the United States and Canada. It is popular to sing on long trips, as it has a very repetitive format which is easy to memorize, and can take a long time to sing. The song's simple lyrics are as follows:
#  ```99 bottles of beer on the wall, 99 bottles of beer.
     Take one down, pass it around, 98 bottles of beer on the wall.```
#The same verse is repeated, each time with one fewer bottle. The song is completed when the singer or singers reach zero. Your task here is write a Python program capable of generating all the verses of the song.

def ninety_nine_bottles_of_beer_lyrics():
    lyrics = ""
    for i in range(99, 0, -1):
        lyrics += (str(i) + " bottles of beer on the wall, " + str(i) +  " bottles of beer.\n" +
         "Take one down, pass it around, " + str(i - 1) + " bottles of beer on the wall.\n")
    lyrics += "No more bottles of beer on the wall, no more bottles of beer. \n" +
        "Go to the store and buy some more, 99 bottles of beer on the wall."
    return lyrics

print (ninety_nine_bottles_of_beer_lyrics())

#20. Represent a small bilingual lexicon as a Python dictionary in the following fashion

#  ```
#  { "merry":"god", "christmas":"jul", "and":"och", "happy":gott", "new":"nytt", "year":"år" }
#  ```
#and use it to translate your Christmas cards from English into Swedish. That is, write a function `translate()` that takes a list of English words and returns a list of Swedish words.

englishSwedishDict = dict()
def translate(englishWords):
    swedishWords = []
    for word in englishWords:
        swedishWords.append(englishSwedishDict[word])
    return swedishWords
    
#21. Write a function `char_freq()` that takes a string and builds a frequency listing of the characters contained in it. Represent the frequency listing as a Python dictionary. Try it with something like `char_freq("abbabcbdbabdbdbabababcbcbab")`.

def char_freq(string_of_chars):
   frquencies = dict()
   for char in string_of_chars:
      if char not in frequencies:
          frequencies[char] = 1
      else
          frequencies[char] += 1
    return frequencies
    
#22. In cryptography, a Caesar cipher is a very simple encryption techniques in which each letter in the plain text is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet. For example, with a shift of 3, A would be replaced by D, B would become E, and so on. The method is named after Julius Caesar, who used it to communicate with his generals. `ROT-13 ("rotate by 13 places")` is a widely used example of a Caesar cipher where the shift is 13. In Python, the key for ROT-13 may be represented by means of the following dictionary:

  key = {'a':'n', 'b':'o', 'c':'p', 'd':'q', 'e':'r', 'f':'s', 'g':'t', 'h':'u',
         'i':'v', 'j':'w', 'k':'x', 'l':'y', 'm':'z', 'n':'a', 'o':'b', 'p':'c',
         'q':'d', 'r':'e', 's':'f', 't':'g', 'u':'h', 'v':'i', 'w':'j', 'x':'k',
         'y':'l', 'z':'m', 'A':'N', 'B':'O', 'C':'P', 'D':'Q', 'E':'R', 'F':'S',
         'G':'T', 'H':'U', 'I':'V', 'J':'W', 'K':'X', 'L':'Y', 'M':'Z', 'N':'A',
         'O':'B', 'P':'C', 'Q':'D', 'R':'E', 'S':'F', 'T':'G', 'U':'H', 'V':'I',
         'W':'J', 'X':'K', 'Y':'L', 'Z':'M'}

#Your task in this exercise is to implement an encoder/decoder of ROT-13. Once you're done, you will be able to read the following secret message:


#  Pnrfne pvcure? V zhpu cersre Pnrfne fnynq!
# Note that since English has 26 characters, your ROT-13 program will be able to both encode and decode texts written in English.

def encoder_decoder(text):
    outputText = []
    for char in text:
       outputText.append(key[char])
    return outputText
    
#23. Define a simple "spelling correction" function `correct()` that takes a string and sees to it that 1) two or more occurrences of the space character is compressed into one, and 2) inserts an extra space after a period if the period is directly followed by a letter. E.g. `correct("This   is  very funny  and    cool.Indeed!")` should return "This is very funny and cool. Indeed!" Tip: Use regular expressions!

#the regular expression part we will learn more about later in the course
import re
def correct(text):
    text.replace('  ',' ')
    re.sub('\.\S','\.\s',text)
